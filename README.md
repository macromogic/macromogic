Hi! This is Weijie Huang (pronunces _Way-Gee-eh Hwahng_), just another ordinary CS student.

I am continuing to pursue my Ph.D. degree at Indiana University Bloomington with Prof. XiaoFeng Wang advising (prior to IUB, I was a Ph.D. student at Rice University supervised by Dr. Nathan Dautenhahn). I obtained my B.Eng. degree at Southern University of Science and Technology in 2022.

I work on computer security. I sometimes compose pop music and write blogs. Check out my new website! :)
